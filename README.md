# Assignment-2:
Consider the linear Test equation for stability of a numerical Method,
y’ = (lamda)*y; y(0) = 1, here (lamda) belongs to set of complex numbers.
Perform the computations for finding Stability Regions for following methods on paper:
1. Euler Method
2. Improved Euler method (or Heun method)
3. Backward Euler method
4. Runge-Kutta method of order 2.
Moreover, generate separate surface plots/contour plots using MATLAB (or Python). Make
comments on stability regions.


Note that:
1. Proper documentation should be used in the codes
2. You have to submit a program and a document (scan copy of hand written derivations)
containing results/discussion on Moodle. Name of the file should be: “Ass2_EntryNu”
3. There will be evaluation of this assignment during some practical session, you will be
informed before.
4. Total Marks for this assignment = 4.
5. No cheating allowed.
